Attack:
Attack and defence mechanism with different strategy:
    Tit for tat: aggressive if were attacked previous turn
    Always Aggresive: Always attacks
    Always Defensive: Never attacks
    to be added.....


Reproduction:
When criteria are met,
A cell may replicate itself to a neighboring cell where its original cell is dead

FUNCTION DONE
just make sure the variable reproduce is positive at the end pf the precess
the new cell will be generated next sim



Symbiosis:
    Type: Parasitic
    Lifetime: 
    Reproduction: 
    Strategy: 
    Disease behaviour:


Disease:
Change the Cell aggressive

Spread to neighbor if not dead next turn



Non-deterministic cells:
Use randomizer class
Actions can be taken includes:
    change aggressive
    change strategy
    change reproductivity




Amoeba:
    life time: 50
    Death condition: have >=3 aggressive around
    reproductive at the end of its life foe 2 generations
    Strategy:tit for tat
    Disease behavior:
        Never aggressive
        Effects all surrounding cells
        life span shortens to 30

Mycoplasma:
    Life time: infinity
    Death condition: <2 or >3 alive cells around
    reproduction: always
    Strategy:Never Attack
    Desease behavior:
        Turns aggressive
        heals if there is 2 healthy cells
        dies after 10 simulation infected
        does not attack surrounding cells

Mollicute:
    Lifetime: 
    Reproduction: 
    Strategy:
